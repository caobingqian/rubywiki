This is the data for a wiki about Ruby development and related tools.

This repository was created by the gollum gem, but you should be able to read and edit the data even without that.

For example, you can click the 'fork' button, click one of the pages, and then click the edit button right in your browser.

If you want to use gollum to update and view the pages with a web interface, do these steps.

Run these commands using a command-line interface (shell) such as the app Terminal.  Ignore the $, just copy the rest of the command.

1. make sure git is installed

$ git -v

2. use git to copy this repo into a folder on your computer

$ git clone git://github.com/schwabsauce/rubywiki.git

3. make sure ruby is installed

$ ruby -v

4. get the needed Ruby code

$ gem install gollum

5. move into the folder into which you copied this repository

$ cd rubywiki

6. run the command 'gollum' to start the server

$ gollum

7. visit http://localhost:4567 in your browser to access the wiki.

8. when you're done using the wiki, you can type control-c to stop the gollum server, or just close the window it's running in.

After you make edits, you can push them back to github if you like.

$ git push origin master

Remember that you'll need to run this from within the rubywiki folder.

$ cd ~/projects/rubywiki
(or wherever you saved it)

Also, you might need to know where you're pushing to.  If you just copied my version of this, you won't have permission to push by default (unless I give it to you).  If you made your own fork before cloning, your push will work.

If, however, you need to tell your cloned repo to push to your own fork, you need to edit a file, replacing my username with yours.  The file, 'config', is in a hidden folder called '.git', inside the rubywiki folder:

~/projects/rubywiki/.git/config

You can edit it like any text file, but since it's in a hidden folder, graphical programs like word processors might not make it easy to find and open.  Some command-line programs that you can use to open it include "vi", "emacs", "mate", and "pico".  Using pico as an example, open the file like this:

$ pico ~/projects/rubywiki/.git/config

Make the edit and figure out how to save it with that particular program.

Now try this.

$ git push origin master

Your system will tell you if it succeeds in pushing your new edits up to github's servers for future sharing.
