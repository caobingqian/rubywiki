Git is a version control system used primarily for source code management.  It saves different versions of your files, so you can keep old backups.

It uses file storage algorithms that allow it to update files very quickly, and without needing lots of storage space.  It also has some pretty advanced features for trying out different versions of your files, and keeping them all well organized and documented.  For these and other reasons, Git has grown in popularity very fast over the last decade, and is now arguably the most popular system of its kind.

One use for git is for saving the daily updates you make while developing new code.  Another use is copying your code to other developers, secure backup servers, and cloud hosting services.  Git has lots of features for collaboration - and the web site GitHub adds many more to the toolbox.
