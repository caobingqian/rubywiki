RubyGems is a system for downloading and installing Ruby libraries.

Libraries are groups of files that work together to solve problems and provide tools.  Library is a word that gets used in a lot of computer literature.  In the case of Ruby, they are usually just called gems.  Rubyists don't usually say "what libraries are you using?".  They ask you what gems you use.

You could also substitute library for most uses of 'tool', 'system', or 'project'.  There are subtle differences between these concepts but they're kind of all the same thing: a group of code files that accomplish some predictable thing when you plug them into a system that knows how to run them.

A few examples of gems include rails, devise, resque, gollum, and mustache.  (Look them up on github and google to see what they do).
