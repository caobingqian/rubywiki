Your computer can launch programs based on words you type.  Instead of clicking on an icon or link, you type a command into something called a prompt.

The computer shows you a blinking cursor to 'prompt' you for your input.  There is usually a $ sign to tell you that it's ready for a command.

The program you use to write commands and get more prompts when they finish is called a shell.  Other common words for them are console and terminal, or just command line interface (CLI).

The Mac app that runs the shell is called Terminal (also referred to as Terminal.app to be specific in some cases).  Terminal is in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder.

Running commands to start programs is done by typing in the name of the program you want to run, and the files you want it to open.  So, if I want to open a file called "shoppinglist.txt" with a program called "mate" (which is a text editor), I would type this into my prompt:

$ mate shoppinglist.txt

Note: the $ is not part of the command - don't type it.  It is just a symbol to show that this command should be typed into a prompt.
Note: commands like this look for the file _in the directory you're in._  You need to learn how to navigate into different directories so you can access all your files.
