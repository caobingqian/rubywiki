Rails is a set of tools and libraries that help you set up web sites and cloud applications.

To use Rails, you use Ruby tools to set up a bunch of files for your app.  Then you edit code in dozens more files to describe the logic and behavior of your systems.  These are usually models that correspond to the things you want to keep track of in real life.
